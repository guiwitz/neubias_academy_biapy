    "# 15. clij on Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great advantages of Colab is the availability of GPUs. While that possibility is mainly exploited to run Tensorflow or PyTorch based deep learning algorithms, other software can benefit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "[clij](https://clij.github.io/) is a library available on multiple platforms that implements a large collection of GPU-based image processing functions. Interestingly, while most GPU software is based on NVIDIA's CUDA library which limits its use to NVIDIA GPUs, clij is based on OpenCL, an open-source library for GPU computing. This makes GPU computing available to GPUs from virtually any manufacturer, and allows everyone to exploit that resource even on a laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "clij is mainly centered on Fiji but is also available for other software such as Icy or Matlab. And there is also an experimental version for Python named [clijpy](https://github.com/clij/clijpy). In this notebooks we demonstrate how to use clij in a notebook and in particular on Colab where one can benefit from powerful GPUs."

    "## Installing components\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in the previous notebook how it was possible to run Fiji and Python together thanks to PyImageJ. On a regular computer, this could be achieved by simply installing that package as well as Java via conda. This installation is more complicated on Colab which offers a more constrained workspace, e.g. where it is not very easy to use conda. The main part of the installation solution comes from [this post](https://forum.image.sc/t/pyimagej-on-google-colab/32804/8?u=guiwitz) on the image.sc forum and [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zo7DZRDK5FJTfEj5gUe4iLl7V4_7r48T). **Note that you only have to do this installation when you start a runtime from scratch. If you installed the components, you can \"Runtime -> Restart runtime\" and they will still be available. In that case jump to the next [section](#clij-via-macro).**"
